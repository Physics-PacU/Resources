## Workflow

1. To start, [**fork**](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) a project repository
2. [**Clone**](http://gitref.org/creating/#clone) the repository to your computer.
3. Modify the files and [**commit**](http://gitref.org/basic/#commit) changes to complete your solution.
4. [**Push**](http://gitref.org/remotes/#push)/sync the changes up to GitHub.
5. [Create a **pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on the original project repository to turn in the assignment. You can continue to submit changes after you create your pull request -- simply commit and push them.

Please **do not** include non-text files in your repository.

### Course Specific Statement on Plagiarism and Academic Honesty

Since computer coding is generally a field where we reuse/adapt other people's codes, it is especially important to be thoughtful in crediting shared work.  Your session work IS a cooperative endeavor and will be worked on jointly, however, any work completed outside of class should be strictly YOURS and not that of your partners.  For labs and homework you must write your own code.  You are encouraged to discuss and debate the ideas in any of your assignments with your instructor and classmates.  If you work on homework/lab assignments cooperatively, rather than independently, you are still responsible for typing up your own work in your own words, especially the physics interpretations.  __Remember, you won't be working in teams on the Midterm exam, so you have to manage your own learning.__

Teamwork and recycling code are common practices in industry, however, if you receive substantial help writing code from a fellow student, or use a help forum for more than a quick reference (on stackoverflow for instance), CREDIT THE SOURCE using the comment section.  If you actually copy-and-paste code from another source, you must:
* understand how it works and what every piece of it does
* tell me explicitly which code you copied and where you copied it from
