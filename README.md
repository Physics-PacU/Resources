## Course description
A special topics course in physics with a focus on computational techniques and numerical methods used in physical science.


## Student Learning Objectives
The aim is to assist you
in developing skills essential for data analysis - both for physics applications and a career
in scientific computing.
This course covers the basics of transforming physics problems in a form readily solved by a computer algorithm.
See the complete syllabus for a granular list of SLO,
but here is a short breakdown.
You will leave the course able to:

  * Evaluate a model system and select appropriate numerical methods for solution.
    * Based on the physics, choose the best model and explain why
    * Identify proper scaling of relevant variables
  * Debug numerical models
    * Catch typical implementation problems
    * Isolate errors with code testing
  * Analyze and present data
    * Generate clear figures from model data
    * Draw conclusions based on numerical results
  * Verify that numerical results are consistent with a physical model, _such as_
    * Energy is conserved
    * Physical bounds are respected
  * Use version control in Github and demonstrate an effective code management workflow.
    * Proper use of clone, pull, push, and merge commands
    * Clear and meaningful commit messages

## Course overview

We will work on a weekly schedule and cover roughly one chapter of Newman per week.  Expect a lot of team work, both during class and for homework.  

### Assessment Due dates

* Project 1 Presentations -  Friday, March 9 - Ch 1-5
* Midterm - in class - Friday March 23 - Ch 1-7
* Final Project - Monday, May 14 3:00pm – 5:30pm  - Ch 1-10


## Grading

* Homework sets - 20%
  * Weekly problem sets are a mix of on-paper and in-notebook work. To be submitted by 5pm each Friday unless otherwise specified.
* Session Work - 20%
* Lab Reports/Projects – 40%
* Midterm exam - 20%
  * The midterm exam is an in-class written exam.
* Final exam
  * There is not an in-class final exam. The final project will take the place of an in-class exam.

## Workflow

1. To start, [**fork**](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) a project repository
2. [**Clone**](http://gitref.org/creating/#clone) the repository to your computer.
3. Modify the files and [**commit**](http://gitref.org/basic/#commit) changes to complete your solution.
4. [**Push**](http://gitref.org/remotes/#push)/sync the changes up to GitHub.
5. [Create a **pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on the original project repository to turn in the assignment. You can continue to submit changes after you create your pull request -- simply commit and push them.

Please **do not** include non-text files in your repository.

### Course Specific Statement on Plagiarism and Academic Honesty

Since computer coding is generally a field where we reuse/adapt other people's codes, it is especially important to be thoughtful in crediting shared work.  Your session work IS a cooperative endeavor and will be worked on jointly, however, any work completed outside of class should be strictly YOURS and not that of your partners.  For labs and homework you must write your own code.  You are encouraged to discuss and debate the ideas in any of your assignments with your instructor and classmates.  If you work on homework/lab assignments cooperatively, rather than independently, you are still responsible for typing up your own work in your own words, especially the physics interpretations.  __Remember, you won't be working in teams on the Midterm exam, so you have to manage your own learning.__

Teamwork and recycling code are common practices in industry, however, if you receive substantial help writing code from a fellow student, or use a help forum for more than a quick reference (on stackoverflow for instance), CREDIT THE SOURCE using the comment section.  If you actually copy-and-paste code from another source, you must:
* understand how it works and what every piece of it does
* tell me explicitly which code you copied and where you copied it from

### Learning Support Services

If you have documented challenges that will impede your learning in any way, please contact our LSS office in Clark Hall (ext.2171; lss@pacificu.edu). LSS staff will meet with students, review the documentation of their disabilities, and discuss the services that Pacific offers and any appropriate ADA accommodations for specific courses.
