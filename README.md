## Course description
A special topics course in physics with a focus on computational techniques and numerical methods used in physical science.

## Prerequisites

* Basic proficiency with computer
* Workshop Physics

## Course objectives
You will leave the course able to:
* Evaluate a model system and select appropriate numerical methods for solution.
  * Based on the physics, choose the best model and explain why
  * Identify proper scaling of relevant variables
* Debug numerical models
  * Catch typical implementation problems
  * ??
* Analyze and present data
  * Generate clear figures from model data
  * Draw conclusions based on numerical results
* Verify that numerical results are consistent with a physical model
  * Energy is conserved
  * Physical bounds respected
* Use version control in Github and demonstrate an effective code management workflow.
  * Proper use of clone, pull, push, and merge commands
  * Clear and meaningful commit messages

## Homework/projects

### Workflow

1. To start, [**fork**](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) a project repository
1. [**Clone**](http://gitref.org/creating/#clone) the repository to your computer.
1. Modify the files and [**commit**](http://gitref.org/basic/#commit) changes to complete your solution.
1. [**Push**](http://gitref.org/remotes/#push)/sync the changes up to GitHub.
1. [Create a **pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on the original project repository to turn in the assignment. You can continue to submit changes after you create your pull request -- simply commit and push them.

Please **do not** include non-text files in your repository.
